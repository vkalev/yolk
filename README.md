## Theme Statement
“Yolk” is a world structured around a central sphere surrounded by fluctuating substructures. The world functions upon the notion of inaccessible data formations forgotten in the process of digital production, supporting the idea of how neglected elements of built frameworks inevitably contribute to their construction.

By drawing the players’ attention towards components such as covert data, aliasing in computing, and hidden cache, “Yolk” attempts to stimulate the experience of unknown familiarities, maximizing the connections between revelation and confusion. Detailed information in the world is not manufactured, but rather extracted from phenomena people recognize in reality and recognizable to the player, hence generating a sense of constant resonance.

While the players traverse throughout the ethereal fields, they encounter a series of novelty compiled through a range of forgotten data; the world constantly reinforces the strangeness upon the player to remind them of its presence and absence. The simple exploration in a world of endless entrances and exits into the system ensures constant involvement within the world.

The excitement of “Yolk” originates from the innate knowledge embedded within the players yet progresses through the agitation of that knowledge being in an unknown environment. “Yolk” is only a glimpse into the immeasurable universe of such a paradoxical adventure through data exploration.
